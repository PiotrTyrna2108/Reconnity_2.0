# ARQ Migration - Summary of Changes

## Overview
This document summarizes the migration from Celery to ARQ for asynchronous task processing in the EASM microservices application. The migration has been completed successfully.

## Changes Made

### Core Components
- Updated easm-core/requirements.txt to use ARQ instead of Celery
- Created ARQ-compatible versions of:
  - easm-core/app/tasks/__init__.py
  - easm-core/app/tasks/scan_tasks.py
  - easm-core/app/api/routers/scan.py
- Updated environment variable naming from CELERY_BROKER_URL to REDIS_URL

### Scanner Modules
Each scanner module was updated to use ARQ instead of Celery:

1. **Nmap Scanner**
   - Updated requirements.txt to use ARQ and httpx
   - Rewrote main.py to use ARQ worker pattern
   - Modified scan functions to be async
   - Updated reporting functions to use httpx instead of requests
   - Updated Dockerfile to use ARQ worker

2. **Masscan Scanner**
   - Updated requirements.txt to use ARQ and httpx
   - Rewrote main.py to use ARQ worker pattern
   - Modified scan functions to be async
   - Updated reporting functions to use httpx instead of requests
   - Updated Dockerfile to use ARQ worker

3. **Nuclei Scanner**
   - Updated requirements.txt to use ARQ and httpx
   - Rewrote main.py to use ARQ worker pattern
   - Modified scan functions to be async
   - Updated reporting functions to use httpx instead of requests
   - Updated Dockerfile to use ARQ worker

### Docker Configuration
- Updated docker-compose.yml to configure all services to use ARQ workers
- Changed environment variable CELERY_BROKER_URL to REDIS_URL across all services

## Testing Instructions

1. Build and start the application:
   ```bash
   docker compose build
   docker compose up -d
   ```

2. Check that all services are running:
   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```

3. Send a test scan request:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/scan" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "target": "example.com",
       "scanner": "nmap",
       "options": {"ports": "22,80,443"}
     }'
   ```

4. Check logs to see if tasks are being processed:
   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f core
   docker compose logs -f scanner-nmap
   ```

## Potential Issues

1. Redis URL parsing may need adjustment based on actual Redis configuration
2. Task queuing and naming conventions may need verification
3. Error handling and reporting might need further refinement

## Next Steps

1. Update monitoring configuration to track ARQ tasks instead of Celery tasks
2. Add metrics support for ARQ (in progress)
3. Update documentation in README.md to reflect the change from Celery to ARQ

## Migration Checklist

- [x] Update scanner services to use ARQ instead of Celery
- [x] Fix import syntax for ARQ workers in docker-compose.yml
- [x] Create queue.py for ARQ worker configuration
- [x] Remove all temporary .new files
- [x] Update dependencies.py to include Redis connection
- [x] Update requirements.txt to remove unused Celery dependencies
- [x] Test the full application workflow
